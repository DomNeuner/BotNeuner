### Yet another Twitch chatbot

It's a chatbot, it's going to do chatbot things.

Realistically, this is starting as me goofing around learning more Python and creating a chat bot because I wanted to.
It most likely will never go live and is just a project to goof around in. Leaving the repo public to A) share it and B)
to teach myself to be a good person and not store my API keys in the script like a lazy piece of shit.

## Requirements

- Python 3 (Currently developing in Python 3.7.2)
- [Twitchio](https://github.com/TwitchIO/TwitchIO)
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)

## Roadmap

- Spotify integration
- Channel points integration
- OBS integration
- _Who the fuck knows what?_
